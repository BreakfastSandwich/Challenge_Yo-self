# Challenge_Yo-self

Welcome to the Challenge Yo-Self Quiz. 

This simple quiz uses various Javascript techniques to generate and render a 5 question quiz. 

The use conditional JavaScript Logic for the main sections provides the feel of multiple pages for the quiz while maintaining page stability on page load, "minimized jumpiness JS code rending text or divs when the page first loads in".

Additionally, the quiz features a countdown timer and score keeping function. the final "page" utilizes local storage to keep track of previous scores.  

I hope you enjoy! :)
